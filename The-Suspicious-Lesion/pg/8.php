		<p class="ninecol first">Excellent! The lymph node capsule is penetrated on its convex curvature by several afferent lymphatic vessels (think “afferent” for “arrive” to the node). These vessels empty into the subscapsular sinus. Lymph then drains into trabecular sinuses that are lined with a discontinuous endothelium<sup>*</sup> penetrated by reticulin fibers and pseudopods of macrophages and dendritic cells that monitor the percolating lymph. Lymph carrying lymphocytes, macrophages, and APCs are able to extravasate from the sinus into the surrounding lymphoid parenchyma. Trabecular sinuses then drain into medullary sinuses. The concave border of the lymph node contains the hilum with a single efferent lymphatic vessel (think “efferent” for “exiting” the node), a small artery, and vein. <br>
		<span class="note">*Sinuses have a lining of continuous endothelial lining where it juxtaposes the lymph node capsule or trabeculae. The endothelial lining is discontinuous in sinuses facing the lymph node parenchyma.</span>

	<p>Lymph flows through each region of the node from the cortex, through the paracortex, then into the medulla. <span class="bold">Explain the difference between medullary cord and medullary sinus.</span></p>

	<p>To avoid doing a complete axillary node dissection (CAD), you wish to pinpoint and remove only the particular lymph node(s) involved and decide to perform a <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=StuUjtXj6u8" class="popup-video">sentinel lymph node (SLN) biopsy</a><sup>*</sup>.</p>
	<p class="note">*SLN biopsy allows for thorough pathogenic evaluation. A radioactive dye is injected and detection of sentinel lymph nodes with a hand-held gamma detection probe identifies areas of increased activity. Nodes with increased radioactivity are labeled as sentinel and removed. Frozen section analysis is preformed and if the SLN is negative for tumor, the node is embedded in paraffin and H&amp;E and immunohistochemistry stained with cytokeratin antibody. Serial sections are taken throughout the node and examined for confirmation.</p>
