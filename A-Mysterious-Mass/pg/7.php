<p>The results of a blood test detected acetylcholine receptor (AchR) antibodies. Based on the symptoms your patient is experiencing in conjunction with the histological analysis leads you to diagnose myasthenia gravis from thymoma.</p>

<p>Thymomas are neoplasms derived from thymic epithelial cells that display skeletal muscle protein epitopes, including acetylcholine receptor, titin, and ryanodine receptor.</p>

<p class="bold">How does a T-lymphocyte problem from the thymus contribute to antibody production that is targeting muscle seen in myasthenia gravis? <input type="text"></p>


<p>You advise for a <a class="popup-video" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VylU8SFE6R4">thymectomy</a> (complete surgical resection of the thymus). The thoracoscopic operation was successful. Surgical margins were negative and there was no evidence of macroscopic or microscopic capsular invasion. Intravenous infusion of immunoglobulin G (IgG) helped to remove circulating pathogenic antibodies and the patient improved.</p>
