<p>The thyroid gland is composed of numerous epithelial thyroid follicles each composed of a central lumen filled with colloid (large gelatinous proteins known as thyroglobulin, which are precursors to thyroid hormones) surrounded by follicular cells (<span class="bold">what is the specific type of tissue</span>?). 
Parafollicular (C) cells are located within and between follicles and secrete calcitonin in response to high blood calcium levels.</p>
