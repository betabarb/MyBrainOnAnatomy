	<p>Correct! The spleen is located in the upper left abdominal quadrant (left hypochondriac region) in the peritoneal cavity. Notice the <span class="purple">white pulp</span> of lymphoid nodules with pale staining germinal centers surrounded by a darker staining marginal zone. The white pulp is surrounded by <span class="red">red pulp</span>, the blood-filled stroma of fine reticulin fibers and cells. A thin capsule and the blood-filled stroma contribute to this organ being easily ruptured by abdominal injuries.</p>

	<p>A few medical residents you are shadowing came from Harvard and they are extremely confused as to the function of the spleen (watch <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aEi_4Cyx4Uw">"What Does the Spleen Do? ft. Harvard Medical School"</a> for homework if you haven’t seen it already!).</p>
