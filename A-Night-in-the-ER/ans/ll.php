<p>Peyerâ€™s patches are prominent in the submucosa of the ileum (the terminal part of the small intestine) and are composed of groups of lymphoid follicles. Lymphoid follicles are mainly Blymphocytes and are examples of MALT (mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue) protecting the mucosal surface of the respiratory, gastrointestinal, and urogenital tracts.</p>
